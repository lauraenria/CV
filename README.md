### Junior Developer

I am an imaginative young individual with a strong passion for coding and web development.  With the ability to multi-task and solve problems I have a strong interest in self-development and learning new applications and software.  I enjoy working as part of a team and individually. I am a polite and self-driven individual who is always eager to get work done and to achieve a deadline.  

I am currently looking for a suitable opportunity that will enable me to learn and grow in a web engineering environment and to encourage me to continue to build on my ability to flourish in any organisation. 

### Skills

#### Working in a Team

When I was working as a waitress in the Berkeley Hotel my team was struggling with agency waitresses who didn’t know the building and our routine. I took the initiative and decided to induct this new member of the team. I wanted them to feel confident and prepared to work to the company’s standards. I was very happy about it because I could see how this improved the situation.

#### Positive Attitude

* Curious, clever and kind
* Aware of my current limits and willing to explore and overcome them
* Passionate about coding
* Keep a diary of my progress (Future blog)
* Willing to help others and mentor them (improve teaching skills)
* I am in love with the tech community and willing to contribute


#### Attention to Details

In my last two careers, attention to detail was a major requirement. As an Aupair and Nanny, it was important to focus on educative technique, 
from being able to organize with the multiple events, to help them to grow up happily and judiciously.
For the older children, it was all about improving my relationship with them and their parents, building trust and confidence. 

In the luxury hospitality industry, I was working at the Berkeley Hotel, with people who were expecting the best service they could ever have. And in order to make their experience perfect detail is everything. We would go out of our way to make everything perfect, from how we knew their favourite food and how to cook them, let them feel warmly welcome and ready to fulfil any of their requests, to tiding up everything perfectly. Top service requires great attention to detail.

#### Communication

Being assertive and improving this skill for me is extremely important. It's a vital key to humans relationship and sometimes I believe most of the problems are about communication. So I take it as my responsibility to have an honest, clear and efficient communication, as much as possible. 

#### Leadership

At the Berkeley, I managed the occasional agency stuff for a while when my team leader was too busy and my responsibility was to introduce them to the hotel's standards and show them their role and places.

Also when I came back to London last July, I began attending the Codecademy Meetup. My goal was to become more confident in leading people when they needed me. I found it to be an extremely friendly and nurturing environment. So I decided to help the organisers with the introduction of new members, explaining the rules and content of the meetup itself, taking care of their questions and their curiosity about coding.

#### Understanding humans
I really like psychology, I believe it has, together with others subjects like neuroscience, the solutions to all the things that I truly care about.  I want to understand why I am what I am, why I act in a certain way, my beliefs, a lot of things about human nature, and the same for the others, I want to understand them, I don't want to assume that my reality and my information are the same by default. And then I want to boost both, I want to help them if I can, to be a better person, to help me through them. I would love also to mentor more generally speaking, in a place like codebar, Rails Girls, or free meetups, or maybe schools (as an extra job), helps other in the little things that I can.
