### Junior Developer

I am an imaginative young individual with a strong passion for coding and web development.  With the ability to multi-task and problem solve I have a strong interest for self-development and learning new applications and software.  I enjoy working as part of a team and individually. I am a polite and self-driven individual who is always eager to get work done and to achieve a deadline.  

I am currently looking for a suitable opportunity that will enable me to learn and grow in a web engineering environment and to encourage me to continue to build on my ability flourish in any organisation.
